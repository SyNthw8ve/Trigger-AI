# What I did:
# Create files with a different name. (For example Softskill -> Softskillz)
# Read the old embeddings and replace old Softskill for new one
# Save
# Delete file with the correct name (Softskill)
# Rename Softskillz -> Softskill
# edit the find_class and add something like:

# elif module == "trigger.models.softskillz":
